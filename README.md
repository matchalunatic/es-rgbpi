Plugins/patches/wrappers that make EmulationStation work with RGB-Pi

Goal: have the RGB-Pi work nicely with EmulationStation with proper resize.

Goal 2: provide an open source toolkit to manipulate the RGB-Pi card.

Please buy your RGB-Pi from http://www.rgb-pi.com as they made a great job
at electronics and for driving the card from a Raspberry Pi.

Big shoutouts to `@Fran_Tron` and `@theretroist` on Twitter who authored the
timings files that are used by this project.

Thanks to `@aTg` for providing me a good motivation to start this project.

# License and authors

All Python code is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 and was authored by me,
[Matcha Luna](https://www.patreon.com/Matcha).

RetroArch and timings files come from the RGB-Pi OS project and are the
property of `@aTg`, `@Fran_Tron` and `@theretroist`. 

I consider them as falling under the GNU GPL v3 as they are distributed
in a RetroPie distribution and are a necessary part of an open-source
implementation of a driving software for the RGB-Pi hardware module.
