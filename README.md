Plugins/patches/wrappers that make EmulationStation work with RGB-Pi

Goal: have the RGB-Pi work nicely with EmulationStation with proper resize.

Goal 2: provide an open source toolkit to manipulate the RGB-Pi card.

Please buy your RGB-Pi from http://www.rgb-pi.com as they made a great job
at electronics and for driving the card from a Raspberry Pi.

Big shoutouts to @Fran_Tron and @theretroist on Twitter who authored the
timings files that are used by this project.

Some thanks too to @aTg who created the RGB-Pi. Your project is a lot of
fun and I'll be glad to help on your interface and system once you open 
source it.
